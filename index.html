        <h2>Why You're Here</h2>
        <p>Hello and thank you for stopping by to help keep Fred's dream alive. You see, Fred has been running his donut
            shop for quite some time now and he's ready to hang up the apron. However, Fred's love for donuts has not
            dwindled in the slightest and this is where your assistance is needed! I've been contracted by Fred to seek
            help in making donuts for his shop while he enjoys retirement and I'm going to make the process super
            simple. Let's give him a hand!
        </p> <br>
        <!-- modal section -->
    <button id = 'modal-button'>How to Play</button>
        <div id = 'info-modal'>
            <div class ='modal-content'>
                <span class ='close'>&times;</span>
                <p>In order to help make donuts, click anywhere on the pink donut image and watch the donut count go up! Fear not, it will get easier, after you make 100 donuts you can trade those in to purchase an auto clicker. This auto clicker will help you make 1 donut every second. There is currently no limit on how many auto clickers you can purchase, but keep in mind after the first Auto Clicker purchased, the price for each one will increase by 10%. <br>
